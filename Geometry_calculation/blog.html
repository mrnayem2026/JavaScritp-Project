                    <p>DOM is like API for web documents
                        Creates a programming interface.
                        <br>
                        The full form of DOM is Document Object Model.
                        DOM can change the structure, style and content of HTML.
                        <br>
                        DOM essentially represents HTML as Nodes and Objects.
                        And programming language with a web page by this DOM
                        Its interface is done.</p>

                    How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>We select HTML elements in several ways to use in DOM, HTML can do.
                        <br>
                        The names of 5 essential methods are given below.
                        <br><br>
                        1 ==> getElemntById('idName');
                        
                        HTML can be selected by id through these methods.
                        <br>
                        2 ==> getElemntsByTagName('tagName');
                        
                        These methods can be selected by HTML tagName.
                        <br>
                        3 ==> node
                        <br>
                        4 ==> createElement();
                        <br>
                        5 ==> appendChild();</p>

                    What is event bubble?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>The event bubbling is a method of event propagation used in JavaScript. Event bubbling is a process that starts with the element that triggers the event and bubbles up the containing elements in order.
                        <br><br>
                        Using the event bubbling in JavaScript, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to the outermost elements.
                        <br>
                        The principle of the event bubbling is very simple. When an event happens on another element, it first runs on the handlers and then on its parent element.</p>

                    What is a callback function and why will you use it?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>One of the more unique aspects of JavaScript is how it handles/treats functions. Functions are considered to be "first-class citizens". This has a couple of different implications.
                        <br><br>
                        functions are objects 
                        you can assign a function to a variable <br>
                        functions can be passed as a parameter to a function <br>
                        The last bullet point is is in bold because it is essential to the idea of callbacks.</p>
